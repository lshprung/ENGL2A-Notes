# Freewrite (WTTGIC morals)

One of the most important things Blair learns in the story is control, both of her own life, and in controlling sled dogs. While these two skills don't necessarily go hand in hand, they both relate to the more general skill of control. Towards the beginning of the story, Blair may be on her own away from her parents in Norway, but she still lacks control over her own body. This is because of her struggling relationship with Far. To get a better sense of what Far had to do with self-control, look at the following quote: "I was not confident enough to articulate what, exactly, felt wrong, but I willed my mother to recognize her "sheltered" daughter would not use such words lightly," (Braverman 48). Here, Blair is talking about how she feels that something is wrong, but she doesn't have the confidence to put those feelings into words. In the afterward, Blair reflects on the independence she had gained through the events in the story, "It was different, dogsledding with no boss, no Tallak or Noah or Dan to grant or withhold their approval," (Braverman 266).
