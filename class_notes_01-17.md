# What's Your Bluebeard (flashwrite)
## Write your own version of Bluebeard

Once upon a time, there was a man with a beard and his wife, a woman with long curly hair. The bearded man had long fancied a vacation to a distant and far-off land called "Admonitan". Even though the bearded man had read up on just about everything there was to know and see about Admonitan, his wife constantly stopped him from going. "Why can't we go, what superstition is it you hold against my dream land?" he would ask. His wife would never give a straight answer, only muttering about the timing not being right, or that she was worried about the weather.
The bearded man pushed for years to go to Admonitan, but as his wife continued to show no interest, he began to grow depressed. The bearded man lost his job as a bartender, and so his wife began to work. The bearded man began to binge drink and experiment with drugs, becoming psychologically disturbed. He refused to be addressed by his real name, only going by The Beard. His wife, oblivious to all this, only ever questioned her husband's mental state when he would go on long winded tangents about Admonitan.
One day, The Beard decided, while on hallucinagens, that he would book a flight to Admonitan by himself. 
He had heard his sofa calling out to him, "what's stopping you from booking a flight yourself? Don't let your wife control you!".
"But my wife! She can't live alone, she has a medical condition. If I left her by herself, even for a few days, she could die!", he said to the sofa. 
"You must go to Admonitan, beard! You have powers like a superhero, and yet you choose to sit here and waste your best days away", the sofa argued.
The Beard boarded a plane the next day without telling his wife. While he was gone, his wife found out that he had left and also discovered his drawer of substances. She had already been struggling with illness and depression, and this was the final straw. She hanged herself the next day.
Meanwhile, The Beard landed in Admonitan. He was overjoyed and finally felt at peace, reaching the land he had dreamt of for so long. The first day there, he went to visit everything, but began to miss his wife. He began to realize that his dream had never been simply to vacation in Admonitan, but to be there with his lover. Disillusioned, he booked a ticket back home. Although The Beard had grown to be very knowledgable about Admonitan, he had forgotten one very important thing: Admonitan was very strict about drugs. The Beard had brought drugs with him, and the Admonitan police were quick to discover this. The Beard was jailed for a minimum of 5 years, doomed to sit still and enjoy his imagined utopia.
