3. Summarize the Article in a paragraph
	- Best done by reviewing an intro paragraph from the Article, then briefly looking over body paragraphs for details
	- Look for Section Headers, Topic Sentences
	- Remember, the summary should be **about the Article**, not the text that it is covering

4. Respond to the Article with critical thinking
