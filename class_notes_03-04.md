# Pecha Kucha Slide Notes

## Nicola

- Nice Pictures
- Try to do one image per slide maybe
- Pictures do not always fill up the whole slide 
- Static white background is boring
- No text! (GOOD)

## Taryn

- I like the color in the opening slide
- Slides that are a glorified word or series of words are mediocre
- "Emergency" Slide does not need the screenshot of the phone (I think)

## Louie

- Consider Image Resolution (make some images sharper)
- Captions are not always necessary (ex. Burnt Out, Nice Weather)
- Only need one selfie

## Erik

- Good title
- A few of the photos are a little blurry/low res
- Story (without a script) is unclear
