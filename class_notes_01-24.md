# Flashwriting

In the reading, we learned about 3 kinds of sources: primary sources, secondary sources, and tertiary sources. Primary sources vary depending on field. For example, the definition of a primary source in literature varies from its definition in history. A secondary source is based on a primary source, and could be seen as a "second-hand account".

# Discussion on Sources

## Primary Sources

- Original Material
- Used to Provide Evidence
- Quotation
- Examples:
	- A journal or a diary of a person at an event
	- Tweet (Twitter)
	- Survey Data
	- The book that you are directly writing about
		- The Bloody Chamber

## Secondary Sources

- Provide Evidence (of a different kind than primary sources)
- Quotation (about the primary source *meta*)
	- Report on primary sources
- Examples:
	- Close Reading Paper
	- Scholarly Articles
	- A tweet about another tweet

## Tertiary Sources

- Report on Secondary Sources
- Compile Secondary Sources
- Examples:
	- Wikipedia (as a whole)
		- Articles serve as "mini-tertiary sources"
	- **Encyclopedia**
	- Anthologies
