# Freewrite about a passage

""Epilepsy," said the guide, breathing hard. "We've tried everything for it." He stroked Lucifer's side with one hand. He was limp," (Braverman 80).

This quote is at first glance simple enough description that doesn't appear to have much to do with anything important in the plot. If one takes a deeper look into this quote, though, they could argue that the dogs epilepsy could be a metaphor for a bigger theme in the story. One interpretation would be that the dog's epilepsy shows that danger can come from everywhere, even from within.
