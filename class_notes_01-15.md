ENGL2A Notes 01/15

# Notes on What a Thesis is

- A thesis is:
	- A claim (not a list)
	- Debatable
	- Should catch a reader's attention
	- Living in the Introduction
	- Can be restated at the end **in a different way**

- Signs of a Weak Thesis Statement
	- Not Debatable
	- Too many details (not often the problem, though)
	- Not specific enough (too general -> not arguable)
	- Hard to distinguish
