# Building a Slideshow (that advances every 15 seconds)

1. Make a title slide with a catchy title

2. You lose the first and last slide, so the last slide should be a burn slide

3. Have a killer slide 2 (since the first slide will just be name and title)

4. Pictures > Words

5. If you *need* words on a slide, keep the number of words limited

6. No Citations (YAY!)
	- There will be a works cited list on the script only

7. Avoid animation on slides (gifs, video, etc.)

8. Avoid a cliche ending

9. Image quality is crucial!!!

10. Put slide # cues on the script

11. Scripts must be memorized, so **practice, practice, practice**
