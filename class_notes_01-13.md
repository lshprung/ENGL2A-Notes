# "On Looking and Looking Again" - What happens when you look at something multiple times
- Notice differences in each analysis
- Notice similarities
- Question yourself
- **This is the same idea as Close Reading**

# Close Reading "The Company of Wolves"
- My word is "**big**"
- **ALLUSION**
	-  The word "big" in the context of the dialogue it is in makes reference to the "Little Red Riding Hood" (or "Little Red Cap") fairytale that this story is a version of.
- **APOSTROPHE**
	- "big" is used as dialogue by the girl to address the wolf. Perhaps this word could be seen as an ironic apostrophe considering that the girl believes to be addressing her grandmother
- **IRONY**
	- by looking at the full dialogue in which the word "big" is used, there is irony in the fact that the girl believes to be addressing her grandmother (when in reality, she is addressing the wolf who is pretending to be the grandmother)
- **PERSONIFICATION**
	- while this goes a bit outside the scope of the word "big", the story uses personification to portray a wolf to be able to speak

- Analyzing Religious themes in "The Company of Wolves"
	- Setting: some kind of European (maybe Germany?) rural area
	- The beginning of the story focuses on the wolf - the take on "Little Red Riding Hood" doesn't begin until later
	- Ending of the story: "If you can't beat em', join 'em"
		- Wolf eats grandmother
		- The girl knows not to be fearful
		- Girl removes clothes and sleeps with the wolf, thus saving herselfand transforming into a wolf
	- This take on "Little Red Riding Hood" switches around roles (i.e. who saves whom)
